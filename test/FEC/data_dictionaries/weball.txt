 
      The file contains information on the campaigns of all 
 individuals who have registered under the Federal Election 
 Campaign Act candidates for the U.S. Senate or 
 House of Representatives.  As such, the file includes a number 
 of individuals who may not be statutory candidates under the 
 1979 Amendments to the FECA, e.g., someone seeking nomination 
 to federal office who has not received contributions or made 
 expenditures aggregating in excess of $5,000.  Also included 
 are some individuals who have been certified by the appropriate 
 state authorities as official Senate or House candidates in a 
  primary, runoff, or general election but who have 
 not registered as candidates under the FECA.
 
      A campaign includes the candidate, the principal campaign 
 committee as designated by the candidate, and any committees 
 authorized by the candidate to accept contributions or make 
 expenditures for the campaign.  This definition of a campaign 
 does not include 1) any office account committee associated 
 with a member of Congress, or 2) any joint fundraising 
 committee authorized by the candidate in conjunction with other 
 candidates or committees.  N.B.  The file for   does 
 include committees authorized by  candidates which 
 exist solely for the purpose of repaying debts from previous 
 elections.  Candidates may choose to authorize a separate 
 committee for this purpose, or they may use one committee for 
 both current and past activity.  As the latter alternative has 
 become more common, fewer so called "debt" committees have 
 existed, and two candidates undertaking exactly the same 
 activity (i.e., debt retirement) would be treated differently 
 if debt committees were excluded.
 
      The file contains one record for each campaign.  The records are arranged 
 alphabetically by state abbreviation, and within state by 
 office sought (Senate, then House) and by Congressional 
 District.  

      It is important that the limitations of the information on 
 this tape be understood.  It represents   data which had 
 been entered into the Commission's computer system as of the 
day before the date of this file.  While it is intended to give 
a complete picture of  the financial activity of these campaigns 
during the two-year election cycle, it is possible that amendments 
to reports will  have been filed after the generation of these files.
 
      Available at the Commission for inspection are microfilmed 
 copies of the original reports which show information as 
 reported by the filers.  The microfilmed public record is the 
 official record of the Federal Election Commission.  This data 
 file is one of several tools which have been developed to 
 summarize the vast quantity of data available on the 
 microfilmed public record.

        cludes all campaigns in which the

        dered to be between two challengers.

        are those of candidates seeking elec-
        tions in  to seats in 
        which an incumbent was not seeking re-
        election.   This category includes

        though monies of special election
        candidates who ran again in the 
        regular 1996 election process appear
        in other records for these candidates,
